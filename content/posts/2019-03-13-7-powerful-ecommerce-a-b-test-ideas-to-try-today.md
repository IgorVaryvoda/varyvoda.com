# 1. Fewer form fields

ðŸ•“ Effort: minutes
ðŸ“ˆ Impact: high

This tip is almost universally acknowledged, and ignored just as much at the same time. 

Remember the last time you were greeted with a huge-ass 16-field form? 
How did that make you feel? 

Exactly. Don't make your customers go through this challenge.

### How to implement?

**Shopify**

No additional apps required. Just configure this in [your settings](https://help.shopify.com/manual/sell-online/checkout-settings/checkout-form-options).

**WooCommerce**

[Booster for WooCommerce](https://booster.io/) is a Swiss army knife which can help you configure this properly.

Sometimes, you just can't get rid of this amazing amount of required fields in the form. This is rare, but it happens. 
This leads us to the next test.

# 2. Try multi-step checkout

ðŸ•“ Effort: minutes
ðŸ“ˆ Impact: high

If you're using Shopify - you've been blessed by this by default. 
WooCommerce, Magento and a bunch of other super popular platform users aren't that lucky. 

# 3. Try 360 photography

ðŸ•“ Effort: days
ðŸ“ˆ Impact: high

Just look at this beauty:

<div class="Sirv" style="margin:0 auto;" data-src="https://demo.sirv.com/DiamondRing/DiamondRing.spin"></div>

You are in full control. 

You can examine every inch of the product.  

Know what that means? 

360 spins increase conversions by at least 27%. They work best for apparel products, jewelry, tech products etc.

# Make reviews more prominent

ðŸ•“ Effort: minutes

The importance of reviews has been [proven](https://www.shopify.com/blog/15359677-why-online-store-owners-should-embrace-online-reviews) long ago. 

Test platforms like [Yotpo](https://www.yotpo.com/) to see where it gets you. 

# 4. No Coupon Fields

ðŸ•“ Effort: minutes
ðŸ“ˆ Impact: high

A coupon field at checkout can  backfire. People see it and try to find a discount code for your store, and people wandering off isn't really a good thing. 

Give it a try, the results might surprise you. 

# 5. Countdown timers

ðŸ•“ Effort: minutes
ðŸ“ˆ Impact: high

Fear of missing out is something that is in our nature. Countdown timers help push your customers into finishing their purchase. 

Be careful with this, the return rate might increase (FOMO sometimes makes people feel guilty for acting on  their impulses). Try to take it into account while testing.



# 6. Try lifestyle product photography & Instagram feeds

ðŸ•“ Effort: high
ðŸ“ˆ Impact: medium-high

Can be a lot of hassle to pull off. Definitely look into this if your products are "Instagram" friendly. 



## 7. Increase website speed

This should not even be up for debate or a test. Most of the time it's possible to significantly increase website speed without sacrificing anything. 

* **Make your store website fast.** Don't forget about product pages, it's highly likely that your visitors will land on those first.
* Use [Sirv](https://sirv.com/?utm_source=varyvoda.com) to optimize and lazy-load images.
